										<p>We usually assume that the mechanical behavior of jointed rock mass around our structure are isotropic, and then design underground projects based on the theories 
										which assume material is isotropic. It is enough for intact rock mass or heavily fragmented rock mass, but it is no longer an isotropic material for jointed rock mass
										with just two or more sets of joint. The difference between jointed rock mass and intact rock is anisotropy. Anisotropy makes significant difference on the strength and 
										deformation of jointed rock mass when external force applies in different directions. The reason of anisotropy in jointed rock mass is that lots of discontinuities exist
										which strength and deformation are unequal under different stress state. In order to understand this complex mechanical behavior, the most important thing is to find out
										how intact rock material interacts with joints movement.</p>

										<h2>Particulate interface model</h2>
										<span class="image right">
											<img src="images/model_pp.jpg" alt="" width="30%"/>
										</span>
										<p>The strength and deformability of rock mass are heavily influenced by the properties of joints, thus the simulation of interfaces is vital and valuable for 
										engineering design. Interfaces can be simulated using various method in particulate DEMs, the advanced one is using a smooth-joint contact model to generate the
										interface. However, the reference-less input parameters are an unsolved problem that makes the smooth-joint model unreliable and uneconomical in engineering design.<p>
										<p>To solve this problem, we proposes a new interface model for particulate DEMs, namely the <b>particulate interface model (PIM)</b>. The PIM performs highly accurate,
										stable, and reasonable simulation of specified interface behaviors between particles. The microscopic parameters of the PIM, such as friction angle and cohesion, are 
										consistent with the macroscopic properties. The required parameters are determined through laboratory tests and field investigation; they can be directly entered 
										into the DEM without time-consuming back-analysis. The PIM can faithfully reflect real-world interface behavior.</p>

										<p>In recent years, numerous researchers have reproduced the mechanical behavior of rock by using the distinct element method (DEM), based 
										on a bonded-particle model (BPM). Compared with a continuum analysis, the DEM has several unique characteristics and advantages, such as the 
										ability to simulate crack propagation or extremely large deformation problems. The discrete characteristics of DEM cause it to be superior to 
										other geotechnical calculation methods for discrete problems. However, these features also increase the complexity of this method, particularly 
										when it is used to determine relationships between micro- and macromechanical behaviors, because they require the complexity of a real physical
										system to be simplified. Simplification is necessary for the construction of a model; however, oversimplification reduces the physical accuracy
										of the simulation. </p>
										<p>To determine the comprehensive mechanical behavior of the bond layer, a complicated bond model for a DEM was developed in this study, which 
										considered bond geometry and the reactions of the bond layer. The premise for the study originated from the cementation of rock. The model was 
										simplified to consider only independent bonds between particles. The shapes of these bonds resemble biconcave lenses; 
										therefore, the model was named the biconcave bond model. Compared with the parallel bond model, this biconcave bond model uses part of the 
										Dvorkin simplified elastic theory to create DEM contacts, rather than employing the Timoshenko beam theory. The major difference between these
										two bond models is bond shape; the parallel bond model uses a rectangular bond, whereas the biconcave bond model assumes the bond is
										a biconcave layer, which is more similar to natural cementation. </p>
